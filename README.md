# Cellular Automata

Cellular automaton is a collection of cells on a grid that evolves through a series of steps under simple rules governing their replication and destruction.

## Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton and a zero-player game devised by mathematician John Horton Conway. It takes place on a two-dimensional grid in which cells can be alive or dead, and is defined by a set of rules that jointly determine the state of a cell given the state of its neighbours. The initial states are random and can achieve stochastic patterns. You may get some cool ones if you're lucky :)

## Langton's ant

Langton's ant is another cellular automaton invented by Chris Langton in 1986. It is basically an ant sitting on a cell grid and the state of cells and movement of ant are governed by a simple set of rules. Unlink game of life, the patterns of this automaton are predictable and limited.
